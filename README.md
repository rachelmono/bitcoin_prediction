# the-price-of-bitcoin
This project bitcoin is done for the 2020 UCLA data science bootcamp hackathon. We aim to use the tools and knowledge we learn understand the behavior of the most popular crytocurrency bitcoin and see if we can come up with an educated prediction of its price trend in the immediate and further future.

In this notebook, we are using data from the Fred api https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ to try to get an overview of what are the factors that associate with bitcoin's price index over the years and generate a few hypothesis to work on.

Bitcoin is not a stock or bond, it does not have a balance sheet. It is also not a currency that is issued by a bank or backed by a government. Ideally, bitcoin would only flutuates with its supply and demand, and its internal governance.

In the following chapters, we take a look at bitcoin's price index over the years and compare it with other ecomonic and market index accessible in the Fed' database and see if we can make some senese of what that means.
